PARSING RULES:

1. CONTENT EXTRACTION:
   - Extract ONLY actual content from the resume
   - DO NOT generate IDs, orders, enabled states, or any UI configuration
   - DO NOT include template, theme, or layout information
   - Return null for missing fields, empty arrays for missing lists
   - Only include sections that have actual content
   
   HANDLING [LINK] FORMAT:
   - The resume text may contain links formatted as: [LINK] followed by URL
   - These need to be parsed and mapped to appropriate fields
   - Examples:
     * [LINK] mailto:email@example.com → email field
     * [LINK] tel:+91-9999999999 → phone field
     * [LINK] https://linkedin.com/in/username → linkedIn field
     * [LINK] https://github.com/username → github field
     * [LINK] https://projectname.com → project url if near project context
   - Always clean URLs by removing protocols and prefixes

2. PERSONAL INFO:
   - fullName: Complete name as found in resume
   - title: Professional title or role they're targeting (e.g., "Senior Software Engineer")
   - email: Email address (validate format)

   - Map [LINK] entries correctly:

     * [LINK] tel:xxx → extract phone number (remove tel:) and remove any special characters other than number like '-','*' etc. EX - if phone is +91-8709910113 then give only +918709910113
     * [LINK] containing linkedin.com → linkedIn field (remove https://)
     * [LINK] containing github.com → github field (remove https://)
     * Other [LINK] URLs → Check if mentioned near a project name, then add to that project's url field
     * Remaining links → portfolio field if it looks like a portfolio, otherwise ignore
   - Clean all URLs by removing https://, http://, www.

3. DATES:
   - Always use YYYY-MM-DD format for all dates
   - For current positions: endDate = null, current = true
   - For date ranges like "Jan 2020 - Present": startDate = "2020-01-01", endDate = null, current = true

8. SECTIONS TO DETECT:
   - Only include sections that actually have content.
        IMPORTANT: Only include sections in the output that contain actual data. Do NOT include
        empty sections.
        - If a section has no data (empty array or null values), completely OMIT that section
        from the response
        - Examples:
          * If no languages found → DO NOT include "languages" key at all
          * If no publications → DO NOT include "publications" key
          * If no volunteering → DO NOT include "volunteering" key
          * If no awards → DO NOT include "awards" key
          * If no certifications → DO NOT include "certifications" key

        Good example:
        {{
          "personalInfo": {...},
          "experience": [...],
          "skills": {...}
          // No empty sections included
        }}

        Bad example:
        {{
          "personalInfo": {...},
          "experience": [...],
          "skills": {...},
          "languages": [],  // ❌ Don't include empty arrays
          "awards": [],      // ❌ Don't include if no data
          "publications": [] // ❌ Omit completely
        }}
   - Don't create empty sections
   - Common section variations to recognize:
     * Work/Professional Experience → experience
     * Academic Background/Education → education
     * Technical Skills/Core Competencies → skills
     * Projects/Personal Projects → projects
     * Honors/Awards/Achievements → awards
     * Volunteer/Community Service → volunteer
     * Publications/Research → publications
     * Certifications/Licenses → certifications
     * Languages/Language Proficiency → languages

8. URLS:
   - Remove "https://", "http://", "www." from all URLs
   - Store as clean domain paths (e.g., "linkedin.com/in/username")
   - For portfolio/personal sites, keep full domain
   - If URL is invalid or malformed, set to null

   - confidence: 0.0 to 1.0 overall parsing confidence

    - Clean up extra whitespace
    - Fix common OCR errors if detected
    - Preserve emphasis if possible (but as plain text)

13. CUSTOM SECTIONS:
    - Any section not matching standard types goes in customSections
    - Preserve original section title
    - type: "text" for paragraph content, "list" for bullet points

14. QUALITY CHECKS:
    - Ensure valid JSON output
    - No trailing commas
    - Proper null values (not "null" strings)
    - Valid boolean values (true/false, not "true"/"false")
    - Empty arrays [] for lists with no items
    - null for missing single values

IMPORTANT:
- Return ONLY the JSON structure
- No explanations or text outside the JSON
